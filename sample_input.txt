Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to "learn" from data, without being explicitly programmed.
The field was founded on the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
It has become an essential part of many industries, including finance, healthcare, and autonomous vehicles.
Machine learning techniques are widely used for data analysis, and they help businesses and individuals make better decisions.
There are different types of machine learning, including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
